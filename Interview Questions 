**1. Types of Missing Data:**
- **MCAR (Missing Completely At Random):** No pattern, unrelated to any variable.
- **MAR (Missing At Random):** Systematic relationship with observed data but not with missing data itself.
- **MNAR (Missing Not At Random):** Missingness is related to the unobserved data.

**2. Handling Categorical Variables:**
- **Label Encoding:** Assigns a unique integer to each category (works for ordinal data).
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Creates binary columns for each category (good for nominal data).
- **Ordinal Encoding:** Maps categories to integers in a meaningful order.
- **Target Encoding / Frequency Encoding:** Uses mean target values or category frequencies (used with caution to prevent leakage).

**3. Normalization vs Standardization:**
- **Normalization (Min-Max Scaling):** Scales values to a range [0,1]. Formula:  
  `(x - min) / (max - min)`
- **Standardization (Z-score Scaling):** Centers data to have mean 0 and std dev 1. Formula:  
  `(x - mean) / std`

**4. Detecting Outliers:**
- **Statistical methods:** Z-score, IQR (Interquartile Range).
- **Visualization:** Box plots, scatter plots.
- **Model-based:** Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, or autoencoders.

**5. Importance of Preprocessing in ML:**
- Ensures **data quality**, **consistency**, and **formatting** for model compatibility.
- Reduces **noise**, handles **missing values**, and transforms features for better learning.
- Prevents **data leakage** and improves **model performance**.

---

**6. One-Hot Encoding vs Label Encoding:**
- **One-Hot:** Binary vectors for each category. Good for unordered data. Increases dimensionality.
- **Label:** Assigns integers. Suitable for ordered categories but can mislead models if used with nominal data.

---

**7. Handling Data Imbalance:**
- **Resampling:** Oversampling (e.g., SMOTE), undersampling.
- **Class weighting:** Adjust model loss function.
- **Algorithm choice:** Use models that handle imbalance well (e.g., XGBoost).
- **Generate synthetic data** or use anomaly detection strategies.

**8. Can Preprocessing Affect Model Accuracy?**
Yes, dramatically. Proper preprocessing improves:
- Feature interpretability.
- Model convergence speed.
- Overall accuracy and generalization.

Poor preprocessing can cause bias, overfitting, or poor predictions.
